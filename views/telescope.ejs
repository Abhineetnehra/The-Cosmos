<h3>Celestron Astro Fi 102</h3>

<p class="milkywaytext">
  Most "GoTo" scopes have microprocessors on board with many lines of dedicated software code and special-purpose keypads cabled to the mount. The Celestron Astro Fi telescopes do away with all that stuff, because you already own it! Your Apple or Android smartphone or tablet makes a perfectly excellent telescope controller. All you need to do is download Celestron's free SkyPortal app from the Apple App Store or Google Play.</p>

    <h3>Celestron Astro Fi 90</h3>
    <img class="milkyimg" src="/images/telescope1.jpg" alt="telescope" />
    <p class="milkywaytext">
      There's no hand controller, no set of manual pointing knobs and no need for a laptop cabled to the mount. You just hold your phone or tab up to the night sky, and the scope will accurately track what's up tonight. Just touch an on-screen target, and your Astro Fi scope will slew to and center that sight, while your smart device displays information about the object.</p>

        <h3>Meade StarPro AZ</h3>
        <img class="milkyimg" src="/images/telescope2.jpg" alt="telescope" />
        <p class="milkywaytext">
          Easily set-up and inexpensively purchased, Meade's StarPro AZ 70mm refractor is ready to attack the sky. But it's equally useful for targets on Earth. Three included eyepieces, plus a Barlow lens, offers your choice of six different magnifications.

            <h3>Orion StarBlast 6i</h3>
            <img class="milkyimg" src="/images/telescope3.jpg" alt="telescope" />
            <p class="milkywaytext">
              If you want the largest light bucket you can get for your dollar, try the StarBlast 6i Dobsonian reflector. You'll get nearly 6 inches (15 centimeters) of aperture on a tabletop turntable, a rocker-arm mount and a pair of 1.25-inch (32 mm) eyepieces. The telescope is very easy to set up, and you'll be observing very quickly â€” pure analog, just as inventor John Dobson intended.
